Overcome and completely silent now  
With heaven&#39;s help  
You cast your demons out  

And **not** to pull your _halo_ down  
Around your neck and tug _you_ off your cloud  

But I&#39;m more than just a little curiuos  
How you&#39;re planning to go about making your amends  

> To the dead

> To the dead

Recall the deeds as if they&#39;re all
Someone else&#39;s
Atrocious stories
Now you stand reborn
Before us all
So glad to see you well',
